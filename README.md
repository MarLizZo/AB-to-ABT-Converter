# Python AB to ABT Converter

Python tool to convert old AB files into the newest ABT-like format
This was a private project for a friend, but i decided to make it public as there are no public converters out there.

### Requirements

To run this tool you'll need the package 'colorama'. My tool uses this package to give some colors to the output.
To install colorama simply run this command:

```python
pip install colorama
```

**NOTE: If this does not work, try pip3 instead of pip**

How to use it to convert your AB file? Very very simple..
Take your AB file and drop it over the .py file :)
